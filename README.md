## Description

Highly hardened and tailored Linux Kernel for Huawei Matebook D 14 2023 (MDF-XX)

This kernel also includes fixes for vswing/preemph tables  
Support for Goodix eSPI fingerprint reader (GXFP5130)  
Burst-Oriented Response Enhancer CPU Scheduler  
And support for some external hardware

External hardware support is being added on demand  
I don't enable all possible hardware blindly

If you need some external hardware support  
You should open an issue

## Building

Clone this repository somewhere and run this command inside it to download Linux Kernel source  
You must have `devscripts` installed

```
uscan --download-current-version
```

You will see a directory named `linux-mdf-xx-<version>` in the upper directory  
Go to it and simply run this command to build the packages

```
debuild -us -uc -ui -b
```

When the building is done you will see `.deb` files in the upper directory

## Why

All modern distributions provide generic kernel which prefers legacy and common drivers over modern alternatives and platform specific options, therefore I made this kernel to target specific platform (MDF-XX) utilizing modern drivers and platform specific options

What benefits will you get from this? In case with this kernel you will notice slightly better performance, smoother experience, faster system boot and significantly better power saving

Also unlike official Debian kernel you will get a seamless BGRT/Plymouth transition using modern EFI DRM instead of legacy EFI Framebuffer
